FAQ
===
**What does 'Anann' mean?** I am fan of Tolkien works :) ! . Anann is _"anann is a Sindarin word for a long time, as in Cuio anann, 'Long live [them]'"_ ([Tolkien Gateway](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Anann)). And anann is intended to help you to manage precisely that: time (in your simulations).
